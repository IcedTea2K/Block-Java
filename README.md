# Block Java

## Description
Block Java is an application that uses *literal* code blocks to give visualization to programming. Similar to [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/about), it is a tool to help beginners approach programming without being overwhelmed by the syntax and language structure. Block Java lets the users drag-and-drop code blocks into the main view to build a simple game. Another feature that makes the application *java-centric* is that it "translates" the code blocks into Java in another view. It therefore allows the user learn the basics of Java syntax, while having fun building a simple game. 

This application is aimed toward high school students who want to get more experience in computer science. As the interface provides an easy way to learn programming, it also teaches the basics of a very practical programming language, Java, which allows the students to later start a project in the language without the application.

## Motivation
There are multiple factors that inspire the project. Firstly, scratch helped me get into programming when I was in high school. It let me build games which I'd always dreamed of doing. Though, scratch doesn't teach languages like Java which are necessary to build larger and more complex projects. So, I want to create a similar tool with some extension to help younger people to get into programming and gain practical experience at the same time. Next, I believe this project will help gain a better insight to how a programming language works. The current plan is to have a very simple interpreter that translate the code blocks into Java code for execution. But, it still requires the most necessary elements of a programming language (such as *grammars*, code generator, etc.). As such, I will hopefully gain more understanding about the backend of a coding language.

## User Stories
### Phase 0
- As a user, I want to be able to add commands to the translator, run them and get the results back.
- As a user, I want to be able to view all the commands that I have input
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a specific command (using index)
- As a user, I want to be able to clear all the input commands from the translator
- As a user, I want to view the list of commands the translator supports
- As a user, I want to get more information about a command
- As a user, I want to the translator to translate the commands into Java.
